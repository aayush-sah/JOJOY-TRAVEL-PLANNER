# 🧭 JOJOY — Your Smart Travel Buddy

**Jojoy** is my **first ever group project** built with the goal of creating a connected, real-time **Travel Planning Platform**. From dynamic destination details to urgent bookings and customized itineraries — it combines user-friendly UI with backend intelligence powered by **OpenAI API**.

This project helped me understand the full development cycle — from frontend UI to backend API integration, and how real-time user needs can be solved effectively using AI.
